# java-fundamentals

## I used these methods in this lab :

+ Math.random() : to get a random number between 0 and 1.
+ Thread.sleep() : to to stop the execution of the current thread for a specific duration (1 second) of the time and after that time duration gets over, the thread which is executing earlier starts to execute again.
