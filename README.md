## I used these methods in this lab 1 :

+ Math.random() : to get a random number between 0 and 1.
+ Thread.sleep() : to to stop the execution of the current thread for a specific duration (1 second) of the time and after that time duration gets over, the thread which is executing earlier starts to execute again.

## I used these methods & things in to solve lab 2:

+ random() : to get a random number between 1 and 6.
+ sort(): to sort the array in asending order.
+ as well as loops and arrays and if statements.
+ then I test it using the terminl to make sure everything working fine.

## I used these methods & things in to solve lab 3:

+ Hashset : I used Hashset in the first problem and the second .
+ Hashmap : I used Hashmap in the second problem.
+ to read from file : I used method two form the reading file methods.
+ then I test it in the test file to make sure everything working fine.
